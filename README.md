Exleveldb
=========

This is an Elixir module wrapping the functions exposed by the Erlang module, [eleveldb](https://github.com/basho/eleveldb).

It may include a few extra convenience functions in the future, for more idiomatic Elixir, but at this point, the goal is just to wrap eleveldb's functions and document it well enough for it to be usable right away.
